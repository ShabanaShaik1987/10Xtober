# 10Xtober: Road to Hacktoberfest

Welcome to **Hacktoberfest**, a month-long celebration of open-source contributions, where developers worldwide come together to contribute to various projects, learn new skills, and make meaningful connections.

This guide is here to help you kickstart your journey into the open-source world through Hacktoberfest.

## Meet Your Instructor

Hi! I’m **Vinit Shahdeo**, a GitHub Star from India and a Senior Backend Engineer at Novo. I’m passionate about helping developers, especially beginners, dive into the open-source world.

## Why Open Source?

Open source is a powerful way to learn, grow, and collaborate with the tech community. Whether you're fixing bugs, enhancing features, or improving documentation, every contribution counts!

## Getting Started with Hacktoberfest

Here’s how to get started with Hacktoberfest:

1. **Create a GitHub or GitLab Account**: If you don’t already have one, sign up on [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).
2. **Register for Hacktoberfest**: Sign up for Hacktoberfest using your GitHub or GitLab account at [hacktoberfest.com](https://hacktoberfest.com/).
3. **Find Repositories to Contribute**: Look for beginner-friendly repositories that align with your skills and interests. You can filter issues with Hacktoberfest labels.

## Ways to Contribute

There are various ways to contribute to open-source projects:

- **Fix Bugs**: Find and fix issues labeled as beginner-friendly.
- **Documentation**: Many repositories lack proper documentation—help by writing and improving docs.
- **Write Tests**: Unit tests are essential and always welcome.
- **Enhance Features**: Work on feature requests and improve existing features.

## How to Find Issues

Use the following labels to find the right issues to contribute to:

- `label:hacktoberfest`
- `label:first-timers-only`
- `label:for-new-contributors`
- `label:good-first-issue`
- `label:easy`

You can also use these helpful search engines to discover issues:

## Making a Contribution

Once you find an issue to work on:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine and set it up.
2. **Fix the Issue**: Follow the project’s guidelines (often found in the README), make your changes, and commit them.
3. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: After you've made your changes, submit a PR. Aim to submit at least 4 PRs by October 31st to complete Hacktoberfest successfully.

## Stay Active on GitHub

Maintaining a streak on GitHub can be as exciting as maintaining one on Snapchat! Keep contributing to stay active in the community.
